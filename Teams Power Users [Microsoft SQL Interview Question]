Solution 1:
SELECT 
  sender_id,
  COUNT(message_id) AS count_messages
FROM messages
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sent_date) = '8'
  AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sent_date) = '2022'
GROUP BY sender_id
ORDER BY count_messages DESC
LIMIT 2; 

Solution 2:
with cte_1 as (
SELECT sender_id,
count(sender_id) as message_count from messages
where date_part('year',sent_date)=2022
and date_part('month',sent_date)=8
group by sender_id), cte_2 as (

SELECT sender_id, message_count, dense_rank()
over( order by message_count desc) as rnk from cte_1
)
SELECT sender_id, message_count from cte_2 where rnk <3;
