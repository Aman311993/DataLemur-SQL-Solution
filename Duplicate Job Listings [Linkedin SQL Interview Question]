Solution :
----Using CTE----------
with job_counts as (
SELECT a.company_id,a.title,a.description,
count(job_id) as no_of_jobs from job_listings a 
group by  a.company_id,a.title,a.description)

SELECT count(distinct company_id) as diuplicates_id from job_counts
where no_of_jobs > 1;

-----Using Subquery-----------------
Solution : 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT company_id) as no_of_duplicates_jobs
from (
SELECT a.company_id,a.title,a.description,
COUNT(job_id) as count_of_job from job_listings a 
group by  a.company_id,a.title,a.description ) as net_jobs
where count_of_job >1;
